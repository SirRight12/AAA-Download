This was a project that was slapped together by me, however I do not own any of the rights nor do I deserve any of the credit for making this. All I did was put this together Scott Cawthon made the Images to the original FNaF 1. So Scott was the main inderect creator of this project.

Anyway with all that boring stuff in the way, don't play this game in class, that is a good way to get this gmae shut down, and that would be very gay of you.
